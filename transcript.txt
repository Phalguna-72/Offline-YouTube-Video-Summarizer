 I'm particularly proud and happy about the young filmmakers, actors, singers, writers, producers that are coming up behind my generation. In particular, Barry Jenkins, young people understand this young man made 10, 15, 20 short films before he got the opportunity to make Moonlight. So never give up without commitment. You'll never start, but more importantly, without consistency, you'll never finish. It's not easy. If it was easy, there'd be no Kerry Washington. If it was easy, there'd be no Taraji Henson. P. Henson. If it were easy, there'd be no Octavia Spensive, but not only that. If it were easy, there'd be no Biola Davis. If it were easy, there'd be no Michael T. Williamson, no Stephen McKenley Henderson, no Russell Horns, BF were easy, there'd be no Denzel Washington.
