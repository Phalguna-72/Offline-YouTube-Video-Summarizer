If it were easy, there'd be no Kerry Washington, Taraji Henson, Octavia Spensive, Biola Davis, Michael T. Williamson, Stephen McKenley Henderson, Russell Horns, Denzel Washington. I'm particularly proud and happy about the young filmmakers, actors, singers, writers, producers that are coming up behind my generation. Never give up without commitment.
